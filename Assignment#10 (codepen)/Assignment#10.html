Ms. Yang speaks about the $10 million dollars in a federal funded (TIGER) grant, for the reconstruction of Fordham Plaza.  Yang states that this project was necessary to provide more pedestrian space, to reduce traffic related injuries, and to boost businesses and the local neighborhood. 
Dr. Feniosky Pena-Mora, Dept. of Design and Construction (DDC) Commissioner, mentioned that “the purpose of the project was also to beautify and create a welcoming gateway into the Bronx.”</p2></b></div>

      <i><h3><em> My New York </em></h3></i>
     <oblique> One place that have a special meaning for me is <i>Fordham Plaza. Fordham Plaza </i>is a small area located in Bronx, New York.  The area is between Fordham Road and Webster Ave. Across the street you can see Fordham University. There are many buses that stop near the Plaza. The Bx41,15, 9, 22, 12, 55, not to mention the Metro North Railroad and Bee-lines buses. Also, there are many shopping stores on Fordham Rd, but that is not why this place is so memorable to me.  This place is memorable to me because this is a stop, I would make before going home or to somewhere else.  I just cannot pass this place without sitting down for a “few” before continuing my travels.  <br><br>
 	I cannot recall the first time I came here. I was very young maybe three or four. Everyday my mother and I would stop by <i>Fordham Plaza</i> to sit, talk, or eat while watching the buses roll by, before boarding the next bus or the Metro-North Railroad to our destination. Most of the time Mom was either taking me to or picking me up from daycare or elementary school. When mom was running late, we would take the Metro-North to my school and her job.  Also, <i>Fordham Plaza</i> was where I received plenty of threats and warnings about misbehaving on MTA. On good days, mom would treat me to a N.Y. dirty water hot dog or a shish kabob.  I remember being afraid sometimes when we had to take the Metro-North because there were many panhandlers there and homeless people sleeping on the broken-down corroded benches. There weren’t many places to sit. You were lucky if you can find a third of a bench to sit on. The place was run-down. There were cobblestone paths to twist your ankle on. Mom did that a lot and so did the high school and college girls, as they run for the bus or train with high heels. <br>
      <br>	I revisited <i>Fordham Plaza</i> as a high school student. My friends and I would stop there to buy one-dollar pizza before going home. The one-dollar pizza place was located where the artwork place is now.  In my high school days, people couldn’t really sit there or should I say you couldn’t sit there for long. silver metal balls were put down. You can sit on them, but not in the summer because they would get very hot. The place was filled with vendors selling jewelry, food, clothes, books, and handmade things. By the time I became a senior, the place was closed for renovation. The place was said to be an eyesore.<i> Fordham Plaza </i>reopened last year and it looked really good. everything was brand new. All the benches were replacement. The plaza now has a bathroom. People can eat their lunch at the outdoor dining area.  employees, students, and families can sit there in peace. <br><br>
 	I would encourage all to go there, especially if you remember what it used to look like. Over the years <i>Fordham Plaza</i> was an eyesore and now it is something for Bronx residence to finally be proud of.  It is place everyone can enjoy.  All of the buses mentioned earlier and the Metro North will take you straight there.  Personally, I would encourage you to go early, because in the evening vendors setup all over the sidewalk. Which is not a bad thing if you like to browse.  <br><br>
      The last time I was at <i>Fordham Plaza</i> was right before the summer. Already there are changes. Two large and very nice sculptures were removed by the city. I was looking forward to taking pictures of them today. A Metro North worker sitting in his work van told me that he “thinks” that the city had removed them. Maybe that was best because several times I would see high school kids trying to climb or sitting inside the sculptures.  Some of the artwork I couldn’t a picture of, because a man had all kinds of stuff that he was selling in front of it.  Plus, today was the farmer’s market day, I had forgotten.  <br><br>
    <i>Fordham Plaza</i> has gone through a lot of changes in the past. This is the best it has ever looked. This Plaza holds lots of memories for me. Even now I will still go there to sit, listen to music, read, and watch the crowd go by. This will always be a good place to take a rest from all the hustle and bustle of the day.</oblique></div></br>
