   My plans this summer is to check out two or three new places or revisit some old favorite spots in the local area. I haven't done in a while,
   and maybe brush up on some photography. These glass images was a challenge to take, because of the sun. But it came out ok.</i></p04>

 <h5><i>I Wanted To Be With Them!</i></h5>
<p05>       
My high school days was a challenge. I hated high school with a passion. As soon as I entered the ninth grade, I was counting down the days until graduation. By the time I got to the tenth grade, I was ready to drop out!  I stood up to my mother and told her that I was not going back.  High school was a waste of my time.  High School was the Government's Education, that is being forced on kids, who donâ€™t want it. Also, I will no longer aim for &quot;A.&quot;  &quot;A&quot;was for Aneurism, that you get from studying. It didn't matter whether one kid get an &quot;A&quot; and the other get a&quot;D&quot; both kids will graduate, I said. My new goal was to strive for &quot;Ds&quot; and make my life easier. It was all planned out perfectly. I was going down to <i>Wall Street.</i><br>
<p05>
I wanted to be with them, and sleep in the tents with college students who were already down there fighting for the &quot;Cause.&quot; The college students were protesting against the government. <u>The Occupy Wall Street Movement</u> was the hottest thing and at fifteen I wanted to join them. Of course, I slept with one eye opened that night because mom did not say a word! The next day I got up and went to school realizing that at fifteen nobody was going to let me sleep in tents on the streets of Manhattan. Also, I remembered that my friends and I had an appointment to play <u>Call of Duty</u> online after school and it was Papa John Friday. What did you expect, &quot;Gimme a Break,&quot; after all I was a MINOR!  Graduation was one of the best days of my life. It meant no more school. That I had survived and completed the Government's Education and was proud!  LOL.<br>
